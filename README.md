- Hello, I am a developer of [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) & [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)/[LuaU](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau), I am currently a solo coder and do random projects only for fun, I am currently more in the language [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)/[LuaU](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau), I spend most of my time coding scripts for Roblox and Gamesense.

- My experience with [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) is 7-8 years and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)/[LuaU](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau) is 4 years, I am not currently coding with the [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) language because it is very boring currently.

- In the [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) language I consider myself front-end & back-end developer, and in the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)/[LuaU](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau) language I consider myself only back-end.

- I like to communicate with new people, I like to talk about random things, things about programming and more, if you want to talk to me I would like to talk to you, so feel free to send me a friend request on Discord.
