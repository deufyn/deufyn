- Hello, I am a developer of C# & Lua/LuaU, I am currently a solo coder and do random projects only for fun, I am currently more in the language Lua/LuaU, I spend most of my time writing scripts for Roblox and Gamesense.

- My experience with C# is 7-8 years and Lua/LuaU is 4 years, I am not currently coding with the C# language because it is very boring currently.

- In the C# language I consider myself front-end & back-end developer, and in the Lua/LuaU language I consider myself only back-end.

- I like to communicate with new people, I like to talk about random things, things about programming and more, if you want to talk to me I would like to talk to you, so feel free to send me a friend request on Discord.
